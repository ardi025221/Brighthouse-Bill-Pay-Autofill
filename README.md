Brighthouse-Bill-Pay-Autofil
============================

A simple javascript that will pre-populate the credit card #, dates, name, and amounts for brighthouse bill payment. It pre-populates the amount field with '1.0', and then puts the focus and cursor at the end of the field.

The main purpose is to let me quickly do partial payments on the bill with my bank card, which requires 10 transactions per month. I like doing 10 transactions of '1.01', '1.02' ... '1.10' so that I know I made the requirements. Then I pay the remainder.
